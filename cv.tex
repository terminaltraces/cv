\section{Other Notable Projects}
\cvlistitem{\textbf{Raspberry Pi Cluster (2015).}   Project undertaken as part of coursework towards Doctor of Philosophy Degree in Computational Sciences.  Created a cluster from four Raspberry Pi 2 devices in a team, and benchmarked the speed improvement as a result of the clustering with the popular High Performance Linpack (HPL) set of tests.}
\cvlistitem{\textbf{PassPlay (2012).}   Project undertaken as part of coursework towards Master of Science Degree in Computing.  Created a proof-of-concept application for authenticating with an Android smartphone with a team.  Application utilized a 3D model which a user would pose in a particular way in order to unlock a phone.}
\cvlistitem{\textbf{RoomGuard: Arduino-Based Personal Security System (2012).}   Project undertaken as part of coursework towards Master of Science Degree in Computing.  Created an Arduino configuration to capture light and motion data for a small room.  Data was forwarded to ThingSpeak, a web service that monitors incoming data for numbers of interest.  Push notifications enabled for Android devices and iOS devices for room entry.  Implemented an Android application that allowed the data to be monitored continuously.}
\cvlistitem{\textbf{Arduino-Powered Furby Choreography (2011).}   Project undertaken as part of coursework toward Bachelor of Science in Computer Science.  Controlled the motor of a Hasbro Furby toy with an Arduino using an H-Bridge.  Connected a new speaker to the Furby and played sine waves from the Arduino over the speaker, while controlling a choreographed motion.}
