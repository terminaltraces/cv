# CV: An Automated Resume Generator

I, like many, am bad at keeping my cv/resume updated.  To fix this, I decided to 
set up a resume repository that automatically keeps track of changes made to my
cv/resume.

Thanks to GitLab's CI/CD, PDFs will be generated upon successful commit! To 
download my latest resume updates, click [here](https://gitlab.com/terminaltraces/cv/-/jobs/artifacts/master/download?job=build).
