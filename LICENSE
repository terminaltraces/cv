This project has two components: my personal data, and the Modern CV template.

All of my data (i.e. images, personal information, job history, and text 
therein) are (c) myself (Drew Williams) and should not be reproduced without my 
express permission.

The template being used for my cv and resume as of 8/2018 is the ModernCV 
template.  Licensing information for this can be found as part of the 
[ModernCV repository.](https://github.com/xdanaux/moderncv)
